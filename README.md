# godot-my-nodes

[![Godot Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/GODOT-%23FFFFFF.svg?style=flat&logo=godot-engine)](https://godotengine.org/)

My custom nodes, writed to help people save time developing games in Godot.

## BasicMovement2D
This script provides a basic player movement, with editable values, and options to sprint and fly.

It also emits signals for each action.

Copy this script to your project, and a new node 'BasicMovement2D' will appear in godot's list, as a KinematicBody2D's child.

### Options available
